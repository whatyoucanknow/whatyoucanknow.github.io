            <p>Before exploring why prison labor is a fruitful opportunity, one needs to understand America’s prison system. Criminal punishment has five possible purposes: incapacitation, deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation, and restitution. Incapacitation removes the defendant from society, deterrence frightens the defendant or the public of punishment, retribution punishes the defendant, restitution satisfies the defendant’s debt to society, and rehabilitation alters the defendant’s behavior. All of these purposes combine to accomplish one goal: prevent crime (The Purposes of Punishment). Although the equal use of these goals may be ideal, some tend to outweigh others in American prisons. The prison system becomes corrupt when retribution and incapacitation dominate prison culture. Incapacitation keeps crime away from the public but does not decrease the prisoner’s desire to commit a crime. Incapacitation only increases crime inside the prison and increases the prisoner’s desire to get even with society (Leopold). Retribution justifies inhumane and unacceptable practices in prison such as bad food, rough guards, and hostile living situations. Rehabilitation is lacking in the current system and needs to be a priority. America’s focus on retribution and incapacitation to achieve the goal of preventing crime needs to change because they promote hostile situations inside prisons and are not effective in reducing the number of criminals. 
	In America, there are more people imprisoned and more money being spent on prisons than ever before in world history. This is mass incarceration, a cyclical system in which more people are going to prison. This is caused by a system where prison time is easily sentenced and prisoners can not re-enter society due to an ineffective prison system. In 1972, there were less than 200,000 prisoners, and now, there are more than 2.2 million. The United States holds only 5 percent of the world’s population, but 25 percent of its prisoners. With this amount of prisoners, America spends $87 billion on prisons per year (“Mass Incarceration”). These statistics show that there are too many people in prison, creating a serious problem that needs to be addressed.
	Mass incarceration is expedited by recidivism, the tendency of a convicted criminal to reoffend (“Recidivism”). In a study done on 404,638 state prisoners released in 2005 across 30 states, 30.4 percent returned to prison in the year after release. After 2 years, that number grew to 43.3 percent and at 5 years it is 55.1 percent. That means that upon release, a prisoner has a 50 percent chance of going back to prison (Durose). Our current prison system is unable to prevent further crime from the majority of prisoners. The system is not working to prevent crime or rehabilitate the prisoner and the long period that a prisoner spends in prison becomes meaningless when the majority return to prison within five years. The problem of recidivism both accelerates mass incarceration and makes prison pointless in its current form when the ultimate goal is to prevent crime.
Retribution and incapacitation mindsets in American prisons foster recidivism and mass incarceration. How should America combat mass incarceration and recidivism? How does America create a system where a prisoner is released and does not reoffend? Redefining prison from retribution and incapacitation to rehabilitation is key. Most prisons have rehabilitation programs through education, counseling, or work. These programs are not implemented across America and are specific to each prison. Currently, most prisoners have the option to hold a job in prison but are never required. Their work could be fulfilled by a work release program where they are employed outside of the prison, work inside the prison where they clean or cook, or with companies that come to prisons for workers. Is prison labor a reasonable tactic to prevent mass incarceration and recidivism? What effect is this work having on a prisoner?
With the dangerous problems of mass incarceration and recidivism today, change must be made. We need rehabilitation of prisoners to combat these problems, rather than incapacitation and retribution that continues the cycle of stripping away the sense of humanity and increasing the poor treatment of prisoners. Some may argue that the solution is to reduce prison sentences. Others may argue that prisons should educate prisoners and provide therapists. Some argue that we should make prisoners work to give money back to the country, others say to make them work to promote real-world habits for an easier transition back into society. 
Work is one of the essential factors for a functioning society. For a prolonged time, men and women have been working in exchange for payment. The first humans worked on the land to put food on the table, most parents work for money, and students work at school for an education. Governments and societies have exploited this exchange throughout history as seen in the gender wage gap, child labor, minimum wage, and slavery. Slavery is when individuals are owned by others. The owners can control where the slaves live and what they do. A slave is seen as property and is forced to work for nothing. Slavery has a long history, from the ancient Greeks to pre-civil war America (What Is Slavery?). Prison labor, often forced labor, is when prisoners are required to work or hold a job in prison. It is important that as a country we can define what prison labor is, so it stays away from corruption and does not become slavery. Prison labor can be separated from slavery by paying prisoners, applying labor laws similar to those in our current workforce, holding an American-wide standard for prison labor, and seeing prisoners as employees rather than property. But why is work so important? What is the purpose? Many would say that work moves the economy, gives people a purpose, and is unavoidable.
The Christian perspective offers a helpful explanation of work, stemming from human nature according to the Bible. One may see work as a hard task often required and easily corrupted. This causes them to see work as a product of the fall, but the Bible reveals that God designed humans to work. In Genesis 2:15, “The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it” (New International Version). Before the fall when Adam was first created, God designated him to work. Sin has corrupted the pure intention of work as seen through slavery, but it is human nature to work. Giving prisoners the opportunity to work is a gift just as God intended work to be; it revitalizes their humanity.
	When looking at the issues of the current prison system, the bigger question we face is human progress and treating humans with dignity. How should the government set its citizens up for success in the world? Currently, prisoners feel degraded by the prison system and life after prison seems impossible, creating a path for prisoners to reoffend and reinforcing habits that make it more likely for them to reoffend. Prison should be a place for rehabilitation, not incapacitation that increases violence. Chandra Bozelko, a Princeton University graduate, is a criminal justice reform author and was formerly incarcerated where she participated in the prison labor system. She has been published on major publications and her blog, recognized as an expert on incarceration. Bozelko realized that “the reason why prisoners are getting in trouble once they are already in trouble in prison is they were not making use of their time, they were bored” (Bozelko). Prisoners are sitting idle in prison. Rather than using their time in prison for rehabilitation, the current system is forcing them to sit in their cells away from society and work. In 1982, the U.S. General Accounting Office realized the issue of prisoner idleness and conducted a study of prison work programs to decrease this idleness, or laziness. The study stated that idleness creates “destructive behavior” and “does little to prepare inmates for reentry into society”, so it is something that has to be decreased before a prisoner reenters society (The United States General Accounting Office). The U.S. government’s answer to ineffective prisons was work. In the study, they came to the overall conclusion that work was good for the prisoner; the prisoner was able to exchange work for a better prison experience and a better life after prison. We need to realize work is the solution and take action on these current issues. The requirement of prison labor is essential to rehabilitation of the prisoner and the decrease of mass incarceration and recidivism. Concerning the issue of whether prisoners should be required to work in public prisons, one must first ask these questions: How does prison labor reform the prisoner? How does prison labor affect the prisoner’s emotional health? Should prisoners be paid for their work?
